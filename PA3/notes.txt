- implemented model based algorithm
    - using the experiences estimated transition probabilities(T), rewards(R) and policy (pi)
    - estimated value function using the above estimates (policy evaluation).
- model based algorithms work better when number of states and actions are low, as in given test cases.
- no extra libraries are used
